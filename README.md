# Torn Stock Bot
The Torn Stock Bot was an experiemental project for analyzing stock trends in a PBBG called [Torn](https://torn.com). The orignal idea was to load
the stock data from the game's web API, store historical data for later analysis, and make recommendations on stock trades. As part of this project, 
I was considering using ML to assist in trend detection.

I abandoned this project for several reasons. The main reason being was that I found myself overwhelmed with trying to understand the algorithms used for stock
analysis. I did manage to add logic to detect certain events such as golden cross but that rabbit hole is very deep.
